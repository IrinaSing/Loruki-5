## Introduction

Our team learns **how to plan and collaborate** working on this repository.
More information about our planning [here](https://github.com/IrinaSing/Loruki-5/tree/main/planning) in the group folder.

## Goals

Our goal is to build a website [Loruki](https://zen-carson-c10c9f.netlify.app/) together. It's not necessary to have a perfect and complex code or to make the website 100% looking alike. Setting up a proper workflow is more important.
