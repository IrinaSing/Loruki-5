# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

Deadline on Sunday. We have only 1 week for the project.

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

It is difficult for us to find time for meetings and discussions suitable for everyone. The first meeting happened on Wednesday.
Some members could not keep up with meeting schedule and could not contribute.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Copying code** from original repo is acceptable, as far as there is not much time for the project.
- **Skipping** some sections of the website that are unnecessary is ok. No or minimum Java-script due to lack of knowledge.
- **One approval** is enough for pull request too speed up the workflow, because there are not always people available for reviewing.
- **One page.** Minimal output is to create 1 html page out of 3.

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
-->
