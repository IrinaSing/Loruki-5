# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

Deadline on Sunday. We have only 1 week for the project.

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

It is difficult for us to find time for meetings and discussionds suitable for everyone. The first meeting happened on Wednesday. Some people have not more than 3 hours per day for coding so tasks will be distributed considering individual schedules.

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Copying code** from original repo is acceptable, as far as there is not much time for the project.
- **Skipping** some sections of the website that are unnesassary is ok. No or minimum Java-script due to lack of knowledge.
- **One approval** is enough for pull request too speed up the workflow, because there are not always people available for rewieving.
- **One html page** out of 3 pages.

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
  - technologies (sometimes you can choose what to use)
