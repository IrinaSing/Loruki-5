## Communication Schedule

When and how often will you meet? what will you discuss at these meetings? ...

## Communication Channels

As a team come up with a plan for how to use each communication channel. What will you discuss on each one? How often will you get in touch on each channel? Below is a starter list of different ways to communicate, go ahead and rewrite this list so it works for your team:

- **Planning Documents**:
- **Slack Messaging**:
- **Video Calls**:
- **Issues**:
- **Pull Requests**:

## Availability

How many hours does everyone have? and when are you generally available?

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
