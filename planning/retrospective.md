# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

Our Project Board is similar to our Development Strategy. Everything that we planed was done!

## Stop Doing

  examples (be specific!):
